## Description
Rice students don’t know where the best place on campus to eat is. H&D doesn’t know which food items students do and don’t like. This web app solves both of these problems by empowering students to review the serveries' menu options as well as see their average ratings.

## Features
1. Ability to view an entire week's worth of menu options easily
2. Ability to rate menu options (1-5 stars)
3. Ability to comment for every menu option
4. Ability to filter menu options based on dietary restriction(s)
