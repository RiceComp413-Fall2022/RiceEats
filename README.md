## Pitch
Rice students don’t know where the best place on campus to eat is. H&D doesn’t know which food items students do and don’t like. To solve both of these problems, we propose creating a web app for students to review the menu items and see previous reviews of menu items. Based on these reviews, we will also collate recommendations for students for the best meal. Some stretch goals would include allowing students to correct any incorrect information on the menu, recommend best meals based on dietary restrictions, and allow students to share photos of the food.
